                While the entire history of chess dates back to the 7th century CE, 
                the history of "modern" chess begins in 1861, when a time limit for 
                making moves was introduced. The time limit was introduced to make 
                matches more fair and competitive as people used to take several hours 
                calculating and planning moves, taking up too much time. <br>
                Starting with sandglasses, the items used for players to track 
                time evolved gradually, from sandglasses to pendulums, then into the 
                familiar modern clocks which have parallel timers and a button to press 
                after each move.

                        American Paul Morphy, an extraordinary chess prodigy, 
                        won against all important competitors, including Anderssen, 
                        during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863.<br>
                        Through his success and innovative way of playing chess, he 
                        pioneers an aggressive style of chess that was daring and reckless, 
                        using a combination of impressive attacks and sound strategy.

                        contribution to chess was the advance of the game's strategic understanding

                        Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti revolutionizes chess by advocating for 
                        control of the center board using distant pieces like bishops rather than 
                        pawns, instead inviting the usage of pawns to attack the opponent's formation. 
                        This introduces a layer of depth for players to consider during games, making 
                        it more complex.

                        Bobby Fischer's period in 1972-1975. <br>Despite breaking the mold and having 
                        a chance to overturn this era of Soviet dominance, he refused to defend his 
                        title going forward. Within this period, there were many changes made to

                        in collaboration with Frederic Friedel. <br>In 1996, Kasparov played a pair 
                        of six-game exhibition matches against IBM supercomputer Deep Blue. 
                        He won the first match 4-2 but lost the rematch 3½-2½(draws are counted as half). 
                        This defeat symbolically heralded the arrival of chess engines playing at grandmaster strength.

            <p id="T2summary">
                When it comes to the earliest roots of chess, its history goes way back to 7th 
                century CE. At this point, chess looked rather different, with its main resemblance 
                being in the core idea of using 4 unique pieces to strategically defeat the 
                opponent. 
            </p>
            <div class="card hidden">
                Originating in India, an early form of chess was developped in 7th century 
                CE. Known as Chaturaṅga, it translates to "four divisions", representing 
                infantry, cavalry, elephantry, chariotry. Later, these pieces would evolve 
                into the modern versions being the pawn, knight, bishop and rook respectively.
            </div>
            <div class="card hidden">
                Chess gets introduced to Persia in around 600 CE. Due to the differences in 
                language, some name pronounciations could not be replicated in Persia. This led 
                to developments like players calling "Shāh!" when attacking the king, and 
                "Shāh! Māt!" when the king was attacked and had no way to escape.
            </div>
            <div class="card hidden">
                After the Arab Muslims conquered the Persian Empire, chess gets spread to 
                various muslim countries. Only a few changes were made to the game during this 
                period, and they were mostly just changes in names or terms to fit the 
                local language.
            </div>
            <div class="card hidden">
                Chess eventually spreads to Europe, then to Russia, and subsequently to 
                other countries in the world. Chess in Europe is developped with some rule 
                changes, as well as the inroduction of new ones. Other countries instead 
                decide to add their own spin, evolving the game into their own unique versions 
                like Xiangqi in China and Shogi in Japan.

                    <h2>Bobby Fischer</h2>
                    Bobby Fischer became a great player from a young age, being the youngest 
                    to win the U.S Chess Championship in 1957/1958. He proceeds to win the next 
                    8 U.S Chess Championships that he participates in, and achieves a perfect 
                    win in the 1963/1964 championship.<br>
                    Later on, he accomplishes an all time record of 20 consecutive wins in 
                    World Chess Championship qualifying events from 1970-1971 before going on 
                    to win the championship in 1972. This win was an outlier, with the past champions 
                    in recent years being all Soviets and having the odds stacked against him.<br>
                    American chess players had less support compared to Soviets, with the latter 
                    receiving state support. In addition, America had far less players at 5000, 
                    compared to the 5000000 of the Soviets, making his training even harder.<br>
                    Despite his strength, Fischer refused to defend his title in 1975 and stepped 
                    away from the chess scene till 1992 due to disagreements with FIDE, who is the 
                    governing body for the World Chess Championship.

                <div class="profile" id="player2">
                    <h2>Garry Kasparov</h2>
                    Garry Kasparov was recognized as a prodigy from a young age, winning both top-level 
                    junior & adult events, including 2 first-place ties at the USSR Championship as a 
                    teen.<br>
                    He went on to defeat Karpov, the reigning chess champion at the time, at age 22 to 
                    become the youngest word chess champion ever.<br>
                    Later, Kasparov would break away from FIDE's jurisdiction, forming his own Professional 
                    Chess Association. He, like Bobby Fischer, disagreed with FIDE's management and additionally 
                    suspected there was corruption within the organisation.<br>
                    During this split, he would aid in the development of chess engines, as well as play 
                    2 of the most iconic and well-publicized chess engine face offs. Currently, chess 
                    engines are widely used for players of all skill levels to practice.<br>
                    He would also later go on to coach Magnus Carlsen, the greatest chess player of today, 
                    for a year in 2009.

                <div class="profile" id="player3">
                    <h2>Magnus Carlsen</h2>
                    Magnus CarlSen is known as one of the most dominant players in chess history, as is 
                    evident by his sheer number of accolades. One prime example of his skill being the 
                    youngest chess grandmaster in the world at 13 years old in 2010. The title of 
                    grandmaster is something only achieved by players in their late teens or early twenties.<br>
                    Currently, he is a five-time world chess champion (until he refused to defend his 
                    title in 2023), five-time world rapid chess champion and reigning world blitz chess 
                    champion.<br>
                    He surpassed the FIDE rating of 2800 at age 18, the youngest at the time to do so, 
                    then going on to reach No.1 in the FIDE world ranking at age 19, the youngest ever to do so. <br>
                    Despite stepping away from the championship in 2023, people never doubted his abilities 
                    as the best, some even joking that he stepped away because he was bored of winning, which 
                    is half true as he claimed to have no motivation.
